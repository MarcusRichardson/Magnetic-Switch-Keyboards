# Magnetic Keyboards: with Adjustable Actuation

**Magnetic keyboards**, often built with Hall Effect switches, are becoming increasingly popular among gamers and enthusiasts. Unlike traditional mechanical or optical keyboards, magnetic keyboards use a magnetic field to detect keystrokes. This allows for advanced features like **adjustable actuation** and **Rapid Trigger**, making them ideal for competitive gaming and ultra-fast inputs.

## What Is a Magnetic Keyboard?

A **magnetic keyboard** refers to a keyboard that uses **Hall Effect switches**. These switches detect the position of a key through changes in a magnetic field, allowing for **contactless key registration**. This not only increases durability but also enables advanced customization features not available in mechanical switches.

### Key Features

- **Adjustable Actuation Point**  
  You can customize how far a key needs to be pressed before it registers. This is ideal for tailoring performance to your preference‚Äîespecially useful in gaming or typing.

- **Rapid Trigger**  
  As soon as a key begins to rise, the actuation point resets. This enables repeated key presses much faster than conventional switches. Great for fast-paced games like *Valorant*, *osu!*, or *Counter-Strike*.

- **Dynamic Keystroke Support**  
  Some keyboards allow per-key actuation profiles and multi-function key behavior depending on press depth.

Most **magnetic keyboards** are **hot-swappable**, letting you change switches easily. They also come in various layouts (60%, 65%, 75%, TKL, full-sized), and some models include **wireless connectivity**, although wired use is generally preferred for lower latency.

## Are Optical Keyboards Magnetic?

No. Some keyboards like the **Razer Huntsman V3** or **BlackWidow V4 Pro** use **optical switches** that offer similar features‚Äîlike Rapid Trigger‚Äîbut they operate using **light sensors**, not magnets. Though they share performance traits, the core technology is different.
